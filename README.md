# Uber data-pipeline project
Brief overview: This project is a simulation of the process of data engineering from getting the source file until the data analytic phase. <br>
Technology used: Google Cloud Platform - Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, Mage AI, Big Query, Looker Studio <br>
Outcome: 
  - Planning stage: describe the technology used and design the data model for analytic usage \
  - Implementation: carry out a data transformation and build a data pipeline, exporting transformed data into a data platform \
  - Data Analytic: Perform data analysis, and present the dashboard. <br>
